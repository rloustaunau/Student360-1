<p>RE: Student Absent from School: {{StudentName}}, {{StudentUniqueId}}</p>

<p>Dear SMCISD Parent or Guardian:</p>

<p class="pdf-p">{{StudentName}} has now missed more than
    {{LetterType}} unexcused days of school/class within the
    last three months of school.
    Excessive school absences lead to lowered performance in student achievement making it more difficult to read, write
    and do math on grade level. In a typical school year, ten or more absences are excessive and {{StudentName}}
    now has more than {{LetterType}}.
</p>
<p class="pdf-p">
    State law requires to attend school regurlarly in order to remain on grade level and graduate on time with her class. Due to
    the number of unexcused absences of {{StudentName}}, the District requires a face-to-face meeting with you and campus administration
    to discuss ways in which to improve her school attendance. If your child is between the ages of 12-18 years old, she will be placed
    on an attendance agreement and referred to additional resources to provide support.
</p>

<p class="pdf-p">
    Please be aware that parent/guardians and/or students (12-18 years old) are subject to court proceedings once the student reaches 10
    unexcused absences within a six month period. Please call the school Attendance Clerk, April Clark, at 512-757-8491 to schedule an
    appointment with a school administrator. We look forward to working with you.
</p>
<br>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
