<p>RE: Student Absent from School: {{StudentName}}, {{StudentUniqueId}}</p>

<p>Dear SMCISD Parent or Guardian:</p>

<p class="pdf-p">Please be aware that {{StudentName}} has missed more than
    {{LetterType}} unexcused days of school/class within the
    last four weeks of school.
    Regular school attendance will help your child accomplish grade level learning in {{Pronoun}} classes and be ready for
    the next grade level or graduation.
    In a typical school year, ten or more absences are excessive and may have a negative impact on your child's
    learning. Students can fall behind if they miss just a day or two every few weeks.
</p>
<br>
<p class="pdf-p">
    As parent/guardian, you are most responsible for making sure your child attends school regularly and turning in
    parent or medical notes to the front office to request that an absence be excused.
    Please call the school Attendance Clerk, April Clear, today at {{SchoolPhoneNumber}} to schedule an appointment with a
    school administrator to discuss {{StudentName}}'s unexcused absences and interventions to improve
    {{Pronoun}} attendance.
</p>
<br>

<p class="pdf-p">
    We look foward to working with you.
</p>
<br>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>{{SchoolPrincipal}}<br>Principal</p>
