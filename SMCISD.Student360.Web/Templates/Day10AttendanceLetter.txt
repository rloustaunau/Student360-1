<p>RE: Student Absent from School: {{StudentName}}, {{StudentUniqueId}}</p>

<p>Dear SMCISD Parent or Guardian:</p>

<p class="pdf-p">{{StudentName}} has now {{LetterType}} unexcused days of school/class within the
    last 6 months of school.
    If your child is in elementary or middle school, this may couse her to be retained in her curent grade level or not be ready
    to perform satistactorily next year. If your child is in high school, this may cause her to lose course credit. High school
    students not meeting credit requirements will be retained in their current grade level for next year if they are unable to make up
    the classwork and/or attendance hours.
</p>
<br>
<p class="pdf-p">
   Failure to attend school may result in a court petition for parent/guardian and/or student (12-18 years old).
</p>
<br>

<p class="pdf-p">
</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>{{SchoolPrincipal}}<br>Principal</p>
